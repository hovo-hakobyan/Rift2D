# Rift2D

Rift2D is a custom 2D C++ game engine that I developed from scratch, along with the recreation of the calssic Digger Game. A lot of decisions that I made were inspired from [Beautiful C++](https://www.amazon.com.be/-/en/J-Davidson/dp/0137647840) by Guy Davidson and [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) by Robert Nystrom.
